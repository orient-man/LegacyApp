# Testing and Refactoring Legacy Code

## Context

Imagine a social networking website for travellers

 * You need to be logged in to see the content
 * You need to be a friend to see someone else's trips

## Legacy Code Rules

 * You cannot change production code if not covered by tests
  - Just automated ("safe") refactorings (via IDE) are allowed,
    if needed to write the test

## Working with Legacy Code Tips

Start testing from shortest do deepest branch

 * because getting to deepest requires big setup i.e. sample data, mocks, fakes etc.
 * allows to understand better what the code does

## HOWTO obtain the code

    git clone https://github.com/orient-man/LegacyApp.git
    cd LegacyApp
    git checkout 0f05084

## Requirements

 * Visual Studio 2010/2012 (better Prof. but Express - free edition - is good enough)
  - should compile without VS (with .NET 4.5 OOTB, for 4.0 try  `git cherry-pick f5db872`)
 * one of many NUnit test runners (NUnit standalone, NCrunch, TestDriven.NET, Mighty-Moose,
   VS2012 built-in + NUnit adapter, R#...)

## Notes before 1st test

 * tip: split screen (both test and tested code)
 * installing packages: `Install-Package nunit -ProjectName LegacyApp.Web.Tests`
 * use snippets for test class / method
 * great tools: NCrunch / Resharper

## First test for shortest branch

 * Before: 0f05084
 * ShouldThrowAnExceptionWhenNotLoggedIn
 * Ctrl-Shift-R / Ctrl-R Ctrl-M - Extract Method "GetLoggedInUser"
 * introducing a seam into the code (to avoid HttpContext)
 * code coverage shows if test covers the branch I wanted
 * refactoring test
 * After: b20759c

## Next: "ShouldNotReturnAnyTripsWhenUsersAreNotFriends"

 * Before: b20759c
 * After: 1613b68

## Next: "ShouldReturnFriendTripsWhenUsersAreFriends"

 * Before: 1613b68
 * PLEASE DO NOT COPY-AND-PASTE NEVER EVER ;-)
 * avoid going to database (TripDao)
 * another example of seam: escaping singleton, static calls and object creation
 * 100% coverage except seams (dependecies)
 * builders (when we need to build rich object graph)
 * After: ca5a502

## Refactoring - Why?

As a code-base grows...

 * Understanding decreases
 * Impact on change increases
 * Costs increase

Refactoring helps

 * Clean up code
 * Improve understanding
 * Minimize impacts of change
 * Increase Maintainability
 * Reduce Costs

## Refactoring - Process

 * Identify Code Smells
 * Perform Impact Analysis
 * Write a Unit Test (sometimes an Integration Test - better than nothing)
 * Refactor

## Refactoring begins

Starting from the deepest branch to the shortest (different than testing)

 * Before: ca5a502
 * method does too much (feature envy)
 * Single Responsibility Principle!
 * Tip for Mac keyboard: Alt+Insert == fn + alt/option + return
 * ShouldInformWhenUsersAre(Not)Friends
 * Resharper: Ctrl+Alt+F -> file structure
 * Resharper: Shift+Alt+Space -> Import symbol completion
 * stay green all the time!
 * Pit stop: e36719c
 * bring variables together (near usage)
 * guard clause to the top
 * get rid of variables (if you can) -> they make for complexity
 * code should be read top-down
 * always baby steps - bit by bit
 * After: 8f7dfed

## What if desing is wrong?

 * Before: 8f7dfed
 * it has dependecy on web framework
 * static call (and dependency on data source)
 * Pit stop: 97510e2
 * test for retrieving trips from in memory db
 * removing static method
 * interface segregation
 * service locator pattern and mocking dependecies
 * get rid of Testable... (ugly) - protected virtual methods only for tests
 * compare before and after - it could take 20 minutes (after some practice ;)
 * After: 3c5b397

## Craftsmen at work

 * Write readable and maintainable code
  - code must express business rules
 * Strive for simplicity
 * Know your tools well (i.e. frameworks, editor)
 * Work in small and safe increments
  - commit often
 * Embrace change, be brave
 * Boy scout rule / No broken windows
